  abstract = {This paper introduces and studies a design framework for designing human-flora interaction in plant-based interfaces, which could play a prominent role in a world where HCI strives to be less pollutive, more power saving, and humane. It discusses critical considerations (e.g. maintenance, reproducibility) for such interfaces, supported by a user study based on an interactive prototype. The results of our user study show that users' interest in plants varies significantly with past experience. Users may create a strong emotional bond with plants, suggesting that organic interfaces should be used for emotionally strong use cases, such as keeping in touch with loved ones or checking important data.},

  abstract = {Plants and specifically indoor pot plants have featured as a prominent object in human-computer interaction (HCI) studies for more than two decades. Motivated by recent discourse in posthumanist and entanglement HCI, this paper seeks to contribute to the more-than-human turn in interaction design. It uses a twofold approach. We first engage in theoretically grounded inductive reasoning to postulate that the role and agency of plants in interaction design projects ought to change. This is backed up with a deductive approach based on a critical metaanalysis using a methodical review of human-plant interaction studies. The analysis identified a range of char\- acteristics that we discuss in relation to study motives and outcomes. Our findings suggest that so far, plants-asobjects in interaction design are used as (i) a proxy for nature; (ii) a trigger for human experiences or; (iii) an interface for other actions. Our synthesis combining theory and meta-analysis contributes to ongoing design discourse on the ethical and societal implications of using plants in technologically mediated environments. We offer reflective remarks on how HCI can re-conceptualise plants from utilitarian objects towards recognising their value as living co-inhabitants.},
